## About the project
This is a micro app that lets you add your GitHub username in the input box and generates a link of your GitHub.

## Steps to follow:
1. Fork this repo.
2. The index.html file is the one where our code recites.
3. We have added some additional CSS in the style.css and used PICO CSS to make the app intuitive.
4. Once done, you can add the GitHub username and generate the link.

## How does it work
1. Add the username here
